phaser-particles

I started with [jsoverson's Javascript-Particle-System](https://github.com/jsoverson/JavaScript-Particle-System). I wanted to integrate [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) with it, and since I changed so much I didn't think I should try to tie it into his branch. Therefore this is my working branch that incorperates all of the greatness of Phaser.
